# SAC-Discrete - COMP3340 Group Project

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains the work for the COMP3340 course's group project. This repo focuses on the implementation of Discrete Soft Actor-Critic algorithm. 

The repository consists of two branches: `main` and `robustness`.

## Main Branch
The `main` branch contains the implementation of the Discrete SAC. The primary goal of this branch is to provide a functional implementation of the SAC algorithm.


## Robustness Branch
The `robustness` branch focuses on exploring the robustness of the Discrete SAC algorithm when provided with noisy input. This branch is still under development and not yet completed. It aims to extend the functionality of the main implementation by incorporating techniques to handle input noise effectively.
